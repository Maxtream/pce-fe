This is a third monthly 5v5 Summoners Rift tournament held on EU west server by our organization. We are just a couple of friends who really love League of Legends, and originally we wanted to promote it in our country, but ended up having players all over the Europe! We were really happy about the recognition and support players have given us, so we want to continue our progress and become better with every tournament! Join us and see for yourselves!
