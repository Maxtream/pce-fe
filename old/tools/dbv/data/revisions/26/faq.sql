(1, 'I want to participate in the tournament, do I need to register?', 'Not quite. There are 2 types of registration on Pentaclick eSports website.<br />1st is considered as guest/participant registration, it is when you don''t want to register on website, but want to participate. You can fill in the tounament form and system will send you a link that is considered you "log in" link. Every time you enter our website by this link, website will recognize you and no additional stuff required. This method is insecure, because anyone can snatch you traffic (if you don''t use secure connection) and get this link easily.<br />2nd registration is a traditional registration. You must go to a registration form, fill in form, receive E-Mail and verify that you are a person. After that you will still need to fill forms for tournament, but few fields already will be filled with info from your profile. Plus you won''t receive any link to E-Mail and it will be connected to your profile automatically, making everything more secure. Also statistics will be displayed in your profile, marking you as participant of the tournament.', 0),
